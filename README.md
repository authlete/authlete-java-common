Authlete Common Library for Java
================================

Overview
--------

This is a wrapper library for [Authlete Web APIs][2].

[Authlete][1] is a cloud service that provides an implementation of
[OAuth 2.0][3] & [OpenID Connect][4] ([overview][5]). By using the Web APIs
provided by Authlete, you can build a _DB-less_ authorization server.
"DB-less" here means that you don't have to prepare a database server that
stores authorization data (e.g. access tokens), settings of authorization
servers and settings of client applications. These data are stored in the
Authlete server on cloud.

[java-oauth-server][6] is the reference implementation of an authorization
server written using this library and [authlete-java-jaxrs][7] library.
It is a good starting point for your own authorization server implementation.

#### How To Get AuthleteApi

All the methods to communicate with [Authlete Web APIs][2] are gathered in
`AuthleteApi` interface. To get an implementation of the interface, you need to
call `create()` method of `AuthleteApiFactory` class. There are two variants
of the method as shown below.

```java
public static AuthleteApi
    create(AuthleteConfiguration configuration);

public static AuthleteApi
    create(AuthleteConfiguration configuration, String className);
```

As you can see, both methods take `AuthleteConfiguration` as their first argument.
`AuthleteConfiguration` is an interface that holds configuration values to access
Authlete Web APIs such as the URL of Authlete server and API credentials of a
service. To be concrete, the interface has the following methods.

| Method                       | Authlete Version  | Description                |
|:-----------------------------|:------------------|:---------------------------|
| `getBaseUrl()`               | Common            | URL of Authlete server     |
| `getServiceApiKey()`         | Common            | API key of a service       |
| `getServiceApiSecret()`      | Up to version 2.x | API secret of a service    |
| `getServiceOwnerApiKey()`    | Up to version 2.x | API key of your account    |
| `getServiceOwnerApiSecret()` | Up to version 2.x | API secret of your account |
| `getApiVersion()`            | Since version 3.0 | API version                |
| `getServiceAccessToken()`    | Since version 3.0 | API access token           |

authlete-java-common library includes three implementations of
`AuthleteConfiguration` interface as listed below.

| Class                             | Description                             |
|:----------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| `AuthleteEnvConfiguration`        | Configuration via environment variables |
| `AuthletePropertiesConfiguration` | Configuration via a properties file     |
| `AuthleteSimpleConfiguration`     | Configuration via POJO                  |

You can use one of these or create your own implementation of the interface. In
either case, you can get an implementation of `AuthleteApi` interface by passing
an `AuthleteConfiguration` instance to `create()` method of `AuthleteApiFactory`
class.

In summary, the flow to get an implementation of `AuthleteApi` becomes like below.

```java
// Prepare an instance of AuthleteConfiguration interface.
AuthleteConfiguration configuration = ...;

// Get an instance of AuthleteApi interface.
AuthleteApi api = AuthleteApiFactory.create(configuration);
```

If you want to do it in an easier way, use `AuthleteApiFactory.getDefaultApi()`
method. This method searches the file system and the classpath for a properties
file named `authlete.properties` and loads the content of the file using
`AuthletePropertiesConfiguration` class.

```java
// Search the file system and the classpath for "authlete.properties".
AuthleteApi api = AuthleteApiFactory.getDefaultApi();
```

`AuthleteApiFactory.getDefaultApi()` method caches the search result, so you can
call the method as many times as you like without worrying about the overhead of
file loading.


#### AuthletePropertiesConfiguration

Among the three implementations of `AuthleteConfiguration` interface, this section
explains `AuthletePropertiesConfiguration` class.

`AuthletePropertiesConfiguration` class provides a mechanism to use a properties
file to set configuration values to access Authlete Web APIs. The class searches
the file system and the classpath for a specified file.

Valid property keys in a properties file and their meanings are as follows.

| Property Key                         | Description                          |
|:-------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| `base_url`                           | URL of Authlete server               |
| `service.api_key`                    | API key of a service                 |
| `service.api_secret`                 | API secret of a service              |
| `service.api_secret.encrypted`       | Encrypted API secret of a service    |
| `service_owner.api_key`              | API key of your account              |
| `service_owner.api_secret`           | API secret of your account           |
| `service_owner.api_secret.encrypted` | Encrypted API secret of your account |
| `api_version`                        | API version. "V3" for Authlete 3.0   |
| `service.access_token`               | API access token                     |

If you don't want to write API secrets in plain text, use
`*.api_secret.encrypted` keys instead of `*.api_secret` keys. You can set
encrypted secrets to the `*.encrypted` keys. But in this case, you have to pass
the encryption key and the initial vector to a constructor of
`AuthletePropertiesConfiguration` so that the loader can decode the encrypted
values. See the [JavaDoc][8] for details.


#### AuthleteApi Implementation

Since version 2.0, authlete-java-common library includes an implementation of
`AuthleteApi` interface using `HttpURLConnection`. Before version 2.0,
[authlete-java-jaxrs][7] which contains an implementation of `AuthleteApi` was
additionally needed.

`AuthleteApiFactory.create()` method searches known locations for an
`AuthleteApi` implementation and loads one using reflection. The reason to use
reflection is to avoid depending on specific implementations (e.g. JAX-RS based
implementation in authlete-java-jaxrs).

As of this writing, known implementations of `AuthleteApi` interface are as
follows.

  1. `com.authlete.jaxrs.api.AuthleteApiImpl` (in [authlete-java-jaxrs][7])
  2. `com.authlete.common.api.AuthleteApiImpl` (in authlete-java-common)

`AuthleteApiFactory` checks existence of the above classes in this order.


#### AuthleteApi Settings

`getSettings()` method of `AuthleteApi` interface has been available since
the version 2.9. By configuring the instance returned by the method, you can
change behaviours of the implementation of `AuthleteApi` interface.

*Examples*

```java
// An implementation of AuthleteApi interface.
AuthleteApi api = ...;

// Get the instance which holds settings of the AuthleteApi implementation.
Settings settings = api.getSettings();

// Set a connection timeout in milliseconds.
//
//   Note:
//     There is no standard way to set a connection timeout value
//     before JAX-RS API 2.1 (which is a part of Java EE 8).
//     Therefore, if authlete-java-jaxrs is used as AuthleteApi
//     implementation and if the JAX-RS Client implementation is
//     not supported by the implementation of setConnectionTimeout()
//     of authlete-java-jaxrs, the value given to setConnectionTimeout()
//     won't have any effect. See README in authlete-java-jaxrs
//     for details.
//
settings.setConnectionTimeout(5000);

// Set a read timeout in milliseconds.
//
//   Note:
//     There is no standard way to set a read timeout value before
//     JAX-RS API 2.1 (which is a part of Java EE 8). Therefore,
//     if authlete-java-jaxrs is used as AuthleteApi implementation
//     and if the JAX-RS Client implementation is not supported by
//     the implementation of setReadTimeout() of authlete-java-jaxrs,
//     the value given to setReadTimeout() won't have any effect.
//     See README in authlete-java-jaxrs for details.
//
settings.setReadTimeout(5000);
```

Note
----

You can write an authorization server using the methods in `AuthleteApi`
interface only, but the task will become much easier if you use utility classes
in [authlete-java-jaxrs][7] library. See [java-oauth-server][6] for an example of
an authorization server implementation written using the utility classes.
