/**
 * Response from Authlete's {@code /auth/authorization/authenticate} API.
 *
 * <p>
 * Authlete's {@code /auth/authorization/authenticate} API
 * returns JSON which can be mapped to this class. The service implementation
 * should retrieve the value of {@code "action"} from the response and
 * take the following steps according to the value.
 * </p>
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR"},
 * it means that the request from the service implementation
 * ({@link AuthorizationAuthenticateRequest}) was wrong or that an error
 * occurred in Authlete.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The service implementation should generate a response with the HTTP
 * status of {@code "500 Internal Server Error"}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} returns a JSON string which describes
 * the error, so it can be used as the entity body of the response.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following illustrates the response which the service implementation
 * should generate.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache
 *
 * <i>(The value returned from {@link #getResponseContent()})</i></pre>
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#BAD_REQUEST BAD_REQUEST}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "BAD_REQUEST"}, it means
 * that the ticket is no longer valid (deleted or expired).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The HTTP status of the response returned should be {@code "400 Bad Request"}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} returns a JSON string which describes
 * the error, so it can be used as the entity body of the response.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following illustrates the response which the service implementation
 * should generate.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">

 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#OK OK}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "OK"}, it means that
 * the response should be {@code "200 OK"}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} returns a JSON string which contains
 * the result of authentication. When the authentication succeeded,
 * the subject of the authenticated end-user and optionally his/her
 * claim values are contained in the response.
