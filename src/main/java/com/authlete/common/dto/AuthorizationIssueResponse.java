/**
 * Response from Authlete's {@code /auth/authorization/issue} API.
 *
 * <p>
 * Authlete's {@code /auth/authorization/issue} API
 * returns JSON which can be mapped to this class. The service implementation
 * should retrieve the value of {@code "action"} from the response and
 * take the following steps according to the value.
 * </p>
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR"},
 * it means that the request from the service implementation
 * ({@link AuthorizationIssueRequest}) was wrong or that an error occurred
 * in Authlete.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an
 * error on the server side. Therefore, the service implementation should
 * generate a response to the client application with the HTTP status of
 * {@code "500 Internal Server Error"}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} returns a JSON string which describes
 * the error, so it can be used as the entity body of the response.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following illustrates the response which the service implementation
 * should generate and return to the client application.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache
 *
 * <i>(The value returned from {@link #getResponseContent()})</i></pre>
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#BAD_REQUEST BAD_REQUEST}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "BAD_REQUEST"}, it means
 * that the ticket is no longer valid (deleted or expired) and that the
 * reason of the invalidity was probably due to the end-user's too-delayed
 * response to the authorization UI.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application should
 * be {@code "400 Bad Request"} and the content type should be {@code
 * "application/json"} although OAuth 2.0 specification does not mention the
 * format of the error response.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} returns a JSON string which describes
 * the error, so it can be used as the entity body of the response.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following illustrates the response which the service implementation
 * should generate and return to the client application.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">

 *
 * <i>(The value returned from {@link #getResponseContent()})</i></pre>
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#LOCATION LOCATION}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "LOCATION"}, it means that
 * the response to the client application should be {@code "302 Found"}
 * with {@code "Location"} header.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} returns a redirect URI which contains
 * (1) an authorization code, an ID token and/or an access token (on
 * success) or (2) an error code (on failure), so it can be used as the
 * value of {@code "Location"} header.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following illustrates the response which the service implementation
 * should generate and return to the client application.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * HTTP/1.1 302 Found
 * Location: <i>(The value returned from {@link #getResponseContent()})</i>
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache</pre>
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#FORM FORM}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "FORM"}, it means that
 * the response to the client application should be {@code "200 OK"}
 * with an HTML which triggers redirection by JavaScript. This happens
 * when the authorization request from the client contains
 * {@code response_mode=form_post} request parameter.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} returns an HTML which satisfies the
 * requirements of {@code response_mode=form_post}, so it can be used
 * as the entity body of the response.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following illustrates the response which the service implementation
 * should generate and return to the client application.
