/**
 * Response from Authlete's {@code /auth/authorization} API.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: In the description below, <i>"authorization server"</i>
 * is always used even where <i>"OpenID provider"</i> should be
 * used.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Authlete's {@code /auth/authorization} API returns
 * JSON which can be mapped to this class. The authorization server
 * implementation should retrieve the value of {@code "action"} from
 * the response and take the following steps according to the value.
 * </p>
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR"},
 * it means that the request from the authorization server implementation
 * was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it
 * is an error on the server side. Therefore, the authorization server
 * implementation should generate a response to the client application
 * with the HTTP status of {@code "500 Internal Server Error"}. Authlete
 * recommends {@code "application/json"} as the content type although
 * OAuth 2.0 specification does not mention the format of the error
 * response when the redirect URI is not usable.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} returns a JSON string which describes
 * the error, so it can be used as the entity body of the response.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following illustrates the response which the authorization server
 * implementation should generate and return to the client application.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">

 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "BAD_REQUEST"}, it means
 * that the request from the client application is invalid.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application should
 * be {@code "400 Bad Request"} and Authlete recommends {@code
 * "application/json"} as the content type although OAuth 2.0 specification
 * does not mention the format of the error response when the redirect URI
 * is not usable.
 * </p>

 * </dd>
 *
 *
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#LOCATION LOCATION}</b></dt>

 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application should
 * be {@code "302 Found"} and {@code "Location"} header must have a redirect
 * URI with the {@code "error"} parameter.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} returns the redirect URI which has the {@code
 * "error"} parameter, so it can be used as the value of {@code "Location"}
 * header.
 * </p>

 *
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#FORM FORM}</b></dt>

 * The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application should
 * be {@code "200 OK"} and the content type should be {@code
 * "text/html;charset=UTF-8"}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} returns an HTML which satisfies the requirements
 * of {@code response_mode=form_post}, so it can be used as the entity body
 * of the response.

 * The following illustrates the response which the authorization server

 * user interface for authentication and/or consent. This happens when the
 * request contains {@code prompt=none}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The authorization server implementation must follow the following steps.
 * </p>
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *     <p><b>[END-USER AUTHENTICATION]</b>
 *     Check whether an end-user has already logged in. If an end-user has
 *     logged in, go to the next step ([MAX_AGE]). Otherwise, call Authlete's
 *     {@code /auth/authorization/fail} API with {@code reason=}{@link
 *     AuthorizationFailRequest.Reason#NOT_LOGGED_IN NOT_LOGGED_IN} and use

 *     <br/>
 *
 *   <li>
 *     <p><b>[MAX_AGE]</b>
 *     Get the value of the max age by {@link #getMaxAge()} method. The value
 *     represents the maximum authentication age which has come from {@code
 *     "max_age"} request parameter or {@code "default_max_age"} configuration
 *     parameter of the client application. If the value is 0, go to the next

 *       <li>
 *         <p>

 *     <br/>
 *
 *   <li>
 *     <p><b>[SUBJECT]</b>
 *     Get the value of the requested subject by {@link #getSubject()} method.
 *     The value represents an end-user who the client application expects to
 *     grant authorization. If the value is {@code null}, go to the next step
 *     ([ACRs]). Otherwise, follow the sub steps described below.

 *
 *   <li>
 *     <p><b>[ACRs]</b>

 *     </ol>
 *     <br/>
 *   <li>
 *     <p><b>[SCOPES]</b>
 *     Get the scopes by {@link #getScopes()}. If the array contains a scope

 *     <br/>
 *     <p>
 *     Note that Authlete provides APIs to manage records of granted scopes

 *     (contact <a href="mailto:sales@authlete.com">sales@authlete.com</a>

 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *     <p>
 *     See "Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0" for details. Note that the
 *     specification is supported since Authlete 2.2. If the Authlete server you

 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *   <li>
 *     <p><b>[ISSUE]</b>
 *     If all the above steps succeeded, the last step is to issue an authorization
 *     code, an ID token and/or an access token. (There is a special case. When
 *     {@code response_type=none}, nothing is issued.) The last step can be
 *     performed by calling Authlete's {@code /auth/authorization/issue} API.
 *     The API requires the following parameters, which are represented as
 *     properties of {@link AuthorizationIssueRequest} class. Prepare these
 *     parameters and call the {@code /auth/authorization/issue} API.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>
 *         <p><b>[ticket]</b> (required)
 *           This parameter represents a ticket which is exchanged with tokens
 *           at the {@code /auth/authorization/issue} endpoint.
 *           Use the value returned by {@link #getTicket()} as it is.
 *         </p>
 *         <br/>
 *       <li>
 *         <p><b>[subject]</b> (required)
 *           This parameter represents the unique identifier of the current end-user.
 *           It is often called "user ID" and it may or may not be visible to the user.
 *           In any case, it is a number or a string assigned to an end-user by your
 *           service. Authlete does not care about the format of the value of {@code
 *           subject}, but it must consist of only ASCII letters and its length must
 *           be equal to or less than 100.
 *         </p>
 *         <br/>
 *         <p>
 *           When {@link #getSubject()} method returns a non-null value, the
 *           value of {@code subject} parameter is necessarily identical to the
 *           value returned from the method.
 *         </p>
 *         <br/>
 *         <p>
 *           The value of this parameter will be embedded in an ID token as the
 *           value of {@code "sub"} claim. When the value of {@code "subject_type"}
 *           configuration parameter of the client is {@link
 *           com.authlete.common.types.SubjectType#PAIRWISE PAIRWISE}, the value
 *           of {@code "sub"} claim is different from the value specified here.
 *           Note that the behavior for {@code PAIRWISE} is not supported by
 *           Authlete 2.1 and older versions. See <a href=
 *           "http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes"
 *           >8. Subject Identifier Types</a> of OpenID Connect Core 1.0 for
 *           details about subject types.
 *         </p>
 *         <br/>
 *         <p>
 *           You can use the <code>sub</code> request parameter to adjust the value
 *           of the <code>sub</code> claim in an ID token. See the description of the
 *           <code>sub</code> request parameter for details.
 *         </p>
 *         <br/>
 *       <li>
 *         <p><b>[authTime]</b> (optional)
 *           This parameter represents the time when the end-user authentication
 *           occurred. Its value is the number of seconds from 1970-01-01. The
 *           value of this parameter will be embedded in an ID token as the value
 *           of {@code "auth_time"} claim.

 *         <br/>
 *       </li>
 *       <li>
 *         <p><b>[acr]</b> (optional)
 *           This parameter represents the ACR (Authentication Context Class
 *           Reference) which the authentication of the end-user satisfies.
 *           When {@link #getAcrs()} method returns a non-empty array and
 *           {@link #isAcrEssential()} method returns
 *           {@code true}, the value of this parameter must be one of the array
 *           elements. Otherwise, even {@code null} is allowed. The value of
 *           this parameter will be embedded in an ID token as the value of
 *           {@code "acr"} claim.

 *         <br/>
 *       </li>
 *       <li>
 *         <p><b>[claims]</b> (optional)
 *           This parameter represents claims of the end-user. "Claims" here
 *           are pieces of information about the end-user such as {@code "name"},
 *           {@code "email"} and {@code "birthdate"}. The authorization server
 *           implementation is required to gather claims of the end-user, format
 *           the claim values into a JSON and set the JSON string as the value
 *           of this parameter.
 *         </p>
 *         <br/>
 *         <p>
 *           The claims which the authorization server implementation is required

 *         </p>
 *         <br/>
 *         <p>
 *           For example, if {@link #getClaims()} method returns an array which
 *           contains {@code "name"}, {@code "email"} and {@code "birthdate"},
 *           the value of this parameter should look like the following.

 * }</pre>
 *         </blockquote>
 *         <p>
 *           {@link #getClaimsLocales()} lists the end-user's preferred languages
 *           and scripts for claim values, ordered by preference. When {@link

 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "INTERACTION"}, it means
 * that the request from the client application has no problem and requires
 * the authorization server to process the request with user interaction by
 * an HTML form.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The purpose of the UI displayed to the end-user is to ask the end-user
 * to grant authorization to a client application. The items described
 * below are some points which the authorization server implementation
 * should take into account when it builds the UI.
 * </p>
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *     <p><b>[DISPLAY MODE]</b>
 *       {@code AuthorizationResponse} contains {@code "display"} parameter.
 *       The value can be obtained by {@link #getDisplay()} method and is
 *       one of {@link Display#PAGE PAGE} (default), {@link Display#POPUP
 *       POPUP}, {@link Display#TOUCH TOUCH} and {@link Display#WAP WAP}.
 *       The meanings of the values are described in <a href=
 *       "http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest"
 *       >3.1.2.1. Authentication Request</a> of OpenID Connect Core 1.0.
 *       Basically, the authorization server implementation should display
 *       the UI which is suitable for the display mode, but it is okay for
 *       the authorization server implementation to <i>"attempt to detect
 *       the capabilities of the User Agent and present an appropriate
 *       display."</i>
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *     <p>
 *       It is ensured that the value returned by {@link #getDisplay()} is
 *       one of the supported display values which are specified by {@code
 *       "display_values_supported"} configuration parameter of the service.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *
 *   <li>
 *     <p><b>[UI LOCALE]</b>
 *       {@code AuthorizationResponse} contains {@code "ui_locales"} parameter.
 *       The value can be obtained by {@link #getUiLocales()} and it is an
 *       array of language tag values (such as {@code "fr-CA"} and {@code
 *       "en"}) ordered by preference. The authorization server implementation
 *       should display the UI in one of the language listed in the {@code
 *       "ui_locales"} parameter when possible.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *     <p>
 *       It is ensured that language tags returned by {@link #getUiLocales()}
 *       are contained in the list of supported UI locales which are specified
 *       by {@code "ui_locales_supported"} configuration parameter of the
 *       service.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *
 *   <li>
 *     <p><b>[CLIENT INFORMATION]</b>
 *       The authorization server implementation should show the end-user
 *       information about the client application. The information can be
 *       obtained by {@link #getClient()} method.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *
 *   <li>
 *     <p><b>[SCOPES]</b>
 *       A client application requires authorization for specific permissions.
 *       In OAuth 2.0 specification, "scope" is a technical term which represents
 *       a permission. {@link #getScopes()} method returns scopes requested by
 *       the client application. The authorization server implementation should
 *       show the end-user the scopes.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *     <p>
 *       The authorization server implementation may choose not to show scopes
 *       to which the end-user has given consent in the past. To put it the
 *       other way around, the authorization server implementation may show
 *       only the scopes to which the end-user has not given consent yet.
 *       However, if the value returned from {@link #getPrompts()} contains
 *       {@link Prompt#CONSENT CONSENT}, the authorization server implementation
 *       has to obtain explicit consent from the end-user even if the end-user
 *       has given consent to all the requested scopes in the past.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *     <p>
 *       Note that Authlete provides APIs to manage records of granted scopes
 *       ({@code /api/client/granted_scopes/*} APIs), but the APIs work only
 *       in the case the Authlete server you use is a dedicated Authlete server
 *       (contact <a href="mailto:sales@authlete.com">sales@authlete.com</a>
 *       for details). In other words, the APIs of the shared Authlete server
 *       are disabled intentionally (in order to prevent garbage data from
 *       being accumulated) and they return {@code 403 Forbidden}.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *     <p>
 *       It is ensured that scopes returned by {@link #getScopes()} are
 *       contained in the list of supported scopes which are specified by
 *       {@code "scopes_supported"} configuration parameter of the service.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *
 *   <li>
 *     <p><b>[DYNAMIC SCOPES]</b>
 *       The authorization request may include dynamic scopes. The list of
 *       recognized dynamic scopes are accessible by {@link #getDynamicScopes()}
 *       method. See the description of the {@link DynamicScope} class for
 *       details about dynamic scopes.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *
 *   <li>
 *     <p><b>[AUTHORIZATION DETAILS]</b>
 *       The authorization server implementation should show the end-user
 *       "authorization details" if the request includes it.
 *       {@link #getAuthorizationDetails()} returns the content of the
 *       {@code authorization_details} request parameter.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *     <p>
 *       See "OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests" for details. Note that the
 *       specification is supported since Authlete 2.2. If the Authlete server
 *       you are using is older than 2.2, {@code getAuthorizationDetails()}
 *       always returns null.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *
 *   <li>
 *     <p><b>[PURPOSE]</b>
 *       The authorization server implementation must show the value of the
 *       {@code purpose} request parameter if it supports <a href=
 *       "https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html"
 *       >OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance 1.0</a>. See <a href=
 *       "https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html#rfc.section.8"
 *       >8. Transaction-specific Purpose</a> in the specification for details.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *     <p>
 *       {@link #getPurpose()} returns the value of the {@code purpose} request
 *       parameter. However, if the Authlete server you are using does not support
 *       OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance 1.0 (in other words, if the Authlete
 *       server is older than 2.2), {@code getPurpose()} always returns null.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *
 *   <li>
 *     <p><b>[ISSUABLE CREDENTIALS]</b>
 *       An authorization request may specify issuable credentials by using
 *       one or more of the following mechanisms in combination.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *     <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
 *       <li>The "{@code issuer_state}" request parameter.
 *       <li>The "{@code authorization_details}" request parameter.
 *       <li>The "{@code scope}" request parameter.
 *     </ol>
 *     <p>
 *       When the authorization request specifies one or more issuable credentials,
 *       the {@link #getIssuableCredentials()} method returns the information about
 *       the issuable credentials. When the information is available, the
 *       authorization server implementation should show the information to the user.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *     <p>
 *       Note that if scope values specifying issuable credentials are dropped
 *       due to user disapproval, the resulting set of issuable credentials will
 *       differ from the originally requested set in the authorization request.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *
 *   <li>
 *     <p><b>[END-USER AUTHENTICATION]</b>
 *       Necessarily, the end-user must be authenticated (= must login your
 *       service) before granting authorization to the client application.
 *       Simply put, a login form is expected to be displayed for end-user
 *       authentication. The authorization server implementation must follow
 *       the steps described below to comply with OpenID Connect. (Or just
 *       always show a login form if it's too much of a bother to follow
 *       the steps below.)
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 *     <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
 *       <li>
 *         <p>
 *           Get the value of {@link #getPrompts()}. It corresponds to the
 *           value of the {@code prompt} request parameter. Details of the
 *           request parameter are described in
 *           <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest"
 *           >3.1.2.1. Authentication Request</a> of OpenID Connect Core 1.0.

 *         <br/>
 *       </li>
 *       <li>
 *         <p>
 *           If the value returned from {@link #getPrompts()} contains
 *           {@link Prompt#SELECT_ACCOUNT SELECT_ACCOUNT}, display a form
 *           to urge the end-user to select one of his/her accounts for login.
 *           If {@link #getSubject()} returns a non-null value, it is the
 *           end-user ID that the client application expects, so the value
 *           should be used to determine the value of the login ID. Note
 *           that a subject and a login ID are not necessarily equal. If
 *           {@link #getSubject()} returns null, the value returned by
 *           {@link #getLoginHint()} should be referred to as a hint to
 *           determine the value of the login ID. {@link #getLoginHint()}
 *           method simply returns the value of the {@code login_hint}
 *           request parameter.

 *         <p>

 *     <p><b>[GRANT/DENY BUTTONS]</b>
 *       The end-user is supposed to choose either (1) to grant authorization
 *       to the client application or (2) to deny the authorization request.
 *       The UI must have UI components to accept the decision by the user.
 *       Usually, a button to grant authorization and a button to deny the
 *       request are provided.
 *     </p>
 *     <br/>
 * </ol>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the subject returned by {@link #getSubject()} method is not {@code null},
 * the end-user authentication must be performed for the subject, meaning that
 * the authorization server implementation should repeatedly show a login form
 * until the subject is successfully authenticated.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The end-user will choose either (1) to grant authorization to the client
 * application or (2) to deny the authorization request. When the end-user
 * chose to deny the authorization request, call Authlete's {@code
 * /auth/authorization/fail} API with {@code reason=}{@link
 * AuthorizationFailRequest.Reason#DENIED DENIED} and use the response from
 * the API to generate a response to the client application.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the end-user chose to grant authorization to the client application,
 * the authorization server implementation has to issue an authorization code,
 * an ID token, and/or an access token to the client application. (There is a
 * special case. When {@code response_type=none}, nothing is issued.) Issuing
 * the tokens can be performed by calling Authlete's {@code /auth/authorization/issue}
 * API. Read [ISSUE] written above in the description for the case of {@code
 * action=NO_INTERACTION}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Authlete 2.3 and newer versions support <a href=
 * "https://openid.net/specs/fapi-grant-management.html">Grant Management for
 * OAuth 2.0</a>. An authorization request may contain a {@code grant_id}
 * request parameter which is defined in the specification. If the value of
 * the request parameter is valid, {@link #getGrantSubject()} will return the
 * subject of the user who has given the grant to the client application.
 * Authorization server implementations may use the value returned from
 * {@link #getGrantSubject()} in order to determine the user to authenticate.
 * </p>
 * </dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p>
 * Authlete 2.3 and newer version support <i>"Transformed Claims"</i>. An
 * authorization request may request <i>"transformed claims"</i>. A transformed
 * claim uses an existing claim as input. For example, an authorization server
 * may predefine a transformed claim named {@code 18_or_over} which uses the
 * {@code birthdate} claim as input. If a client application requests the
 * {@code 18_or_over} transformed claim, the authorization server needs to
 * prepare the value of the {@code birthdate} claim and passes it to Authlete's
 * {@code /api/auth/authorization/issue} API so that Authlete can compute the
 * value of the {@code 18_or_over} transformed claim. See the descriptions
 * of {@link #getRequestedClaimsForTx()} and {@link #getRequestedVerifiedClaimsForTx()}
 * for details.
