/**
 * Response from Authlete's {@code /api/backchannel/authentication/complete}
 * API.
 *
 * <p>
 * Authlete's {@code /api/backchannel/authentication/complete} API returns JSON
 * which can be mapped to this class. The authorization server implementation
 * should retrieve the value of {@code action} from the response and take the
 * following steps according to the value.
 * </p>
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#NOTIFICATION NOTIFICATION}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code action} is {@code NOTIFICATION}, it means that the
 * authorization server must send a notification to the client notification
 * endpoint.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * According to the CIBA Core specification, the notification is an HTTP POST
 * request whose request body is JSON and whose {@code Authorization} header
 * contains the client notification token, which was included in the
 * backchannel authentication request as the value of the
 * {@code client_notification_token} request parameter, as a bearer token.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the backchannel token delivery mode is "ping", the request body of the
 * notification is JSON which contains the {@code auth_req_id} property only.
 * When the backchannel token delivery mode is "push", the request body will
 * additionally contain an access token, an ID token and other properties.
 * Note that when the backchannel token delivery mode is "poll", a notification
 * does not have to be sent to the client notification endpoint.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In error cases, in the "ping" mode, however, the content of a notification
 * is not different from the content in successful cases. That is, the
 * notification contains the {@code auth_req_id} property only. The client
 * will know the error when it accesses the token endpoint. On the other hand,
 * in the "push" mode, in error cases, the content of a notification will
 * include the {@code error} property instead of an access token and an ID
 * token. The client will know the error by detecting that {@code error} is
 * included in the notification.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In any case, the {@link #getResponseContent()} method returns JSON which
 * can be used as the request body of the notification.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The client notification endpoint that the notification should be sent to can
 * be obtained by calling the {@link #getClientNotificationEndpoint()} method.
 * Likewise, the client notification token that the notification should include
 * as a bearer token can be obtained by calling the
 * {@link #getClientNotificationToken()} method. With these methods, the
 * notification can be built like the following.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * POST <i>(The path of {@link #getClientNotificationEndpoint()})</i> HTTP/1.1
 * HOST: <i>(The host of {@link #getClientNotificationEndpoint()})</i>
 * Authorization: Bearer <i>(The value returned from {@link #getClientNotificationToken()})</i>
 * Content-Type: application/json
 *
 * <i>(The value returned from {@link #getResponseContent()})</i></pre>
 * <br/>
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#NO_ACTION NO_ACTION}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code action} is {@code NO_ACTION}, it means that the
 * authorization server does not have to take any immediate action.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code NO_ACTION} is returned when the backchannel token delivery mode is
 * "poll". In this case, the client will receive the final result at the token
 * endpoint.
 * </p>
 * <br/>
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#SERVER_ERROR SERVER_ERROR}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code action} is {@code SERVER_ERROR}, it means either
 * (1) that the request from the authorization server to Authlete was wrong,
 * or (2) that an error occurred on Authlete side.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the backchannel token delivery mode is "ping" or "push",
 * {@code SERVER_ERROR} is used only when an error is detected before the
 * record of the ticket (which is included in the API call to
 * {@code /api/backchannel/authentication/complete}) is retrieved from the
 * database successfully. If an error is detected <em>after</em> the record of
 * the ticket is retrieved from the database, {@code NOTIFICATION} is used
 * instead of {@code SERVER_ERROR}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the backchannel token delivery mode is "poll", {@code SERVER_ERROR} is
 * used regardless of whether it is before or after the record of the ticket is
 * retrieved from the database.
 * </p>
