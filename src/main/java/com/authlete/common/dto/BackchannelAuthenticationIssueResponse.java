/**
 * Response from Authlete's {@code /api/backchannel/authentication/issue} API.
 *
 * <p>
 * Authlete's {@code /api/backchannel/authentication/issue} API returns JSON
 * which can be mapped to this class. The authorization server implementation
 * should retrieve the value of {@code action} from the response and take the
 * following steps according to the value.
 * </p>
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#OK OK}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code action} is {@code OK}, it means that Authlete has
 * succeeded in preparing JSON that contains an {@code auth_req_id}. The JSON
 * should be used as the response body of the response which is returned to
 * the client from the backchannel authentication endpoint. The
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} method returns the JSON.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following illustrates the response which the authorization server
 * implementation should generate and return to the client application.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache
 *
 * <i>(The value returned from {@link #getResponseContent()})</i></pre>
 * <br/>
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code action} is {@code INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR}, it means
 * that an error occurred in Authlete.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * From a viewpoint of the client application, this is an error on the server
 * side. Therefore, the authorization server implementation should generate a
 * response to the client application with {@code 500 Internal Server Error}
 * and {@code application/json}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link #getResponseContent()} method returns a JSON string which
 * describes the error, so it can be used as the entity body of the response.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following illustrates the response which the authorization server
 * implementation should generate and return to the client application.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache
 *
 * <i>(The value returned from {@link #getResponseContent()})</i></pre>
 * <br/>
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#INVALID_TICKET INVALID_TICKET}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code action} is {@code INVALID_TICKET}, it means that
 * the ticket included in the API call was invalid. For example, it does not
 * exist or has expired.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * From a viewpoint of the client application, this is an error on the server
 * side. Therefore, the authorization server implementation should generate a
 * response to the client application with {@code 500 Internal Server Error}
 * and {@code application/json}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can build an error response in the same way as shown in the description
 * for the case of {@code INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR}.
