 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code action} is {@code USER_IDENTIFICATION}, it means
 * that the backchannel authentication request from the client application is
 * valid. The authorization server implementation has to follow the steps below.
 * </p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * <p><b>[END-USER IDENTIFICATION]</b></p>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <p>
 * The first step is to determine the subject (= unique identifier) of the
 * end-user from whom the client application wants to get authorization.
 * </p>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <p>
 * According to the CIBA specification, a backchannel authentication request
 * contains one (and only one) of the {@code login_hint_token},
 * {@code id_token_hint} and {@code login_hint} request parameters as a hint
 * by which the authorization server identifies the subject of an end-user.
 * </p>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <p>
 * The authorization server implementation can know which hint is included in
 * the backchannel authentication request by calling the {@link #getHintType()}
 * method. The method returns a {@link UserIdentificationHintType} instance
 * that indicates which hint is included. For example, when the method returns
 * {@link UserIdentificationHintType#LOGIN_HINT LOGIN_HINT}, it means that the
 * backchannel authentication request contains the {@code login_hint} request
 * parameter as a hint.
 * </p>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link #getHint()} method returns the value of the hint. For example,
 * when the {@code getHintType()} method returns {@code LOGIN_HINT}, the
 * {@code getHint()} method returns the value of the {@code login_hint} request
 * parameter.
 * </p>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is up to the authorization server implementation how to determine the
 * subject of the end-user from the hint. There are few things Authlete can
 * help. Only one thing Authlete can do is to let the {@link #getSub()} method
 * return the value of the {@code sub} claim in the {@code id_token_hint}
 * request parameter when the request parameter is used.
 * </p>
 * <br/><br/>
 * </li>
 *
 * <li>
 * <p><b>[END-USER IDENTIFICATION ERROR]</b></p>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <p>
 * There are some cases where the authorization server implementation
 * encounters an error during the user identification process. In any error
 * case, the authorization server implementation has to return an HTTP response
 * with the {@code error} response parameter to the client application. The
 * following is an example of such error responses.
 * </p>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache
 *
 * {"error":"unknown_user_id"}</pre>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <p>
 * Authlete provides {@code /api/backchannel/authentication/fail} API that
 * builds the response body (JSON) of an error response. However, because
 * it is easy to build an error response manually, you may choose not to
 * call the API. One good thing in using the API is that the API call can
 * trigger deletion of the ticket which has been issued from Authlete's
 * {@code /api/backchannel/authentication} API. If you don't call
 * {@code /api/backchannel/authentication/fail} API, the ticket will continue
 * to exist in the database until it is cleaned up by the batch program after
 * the ticket expires.
 * </p>
 * <br/>
 *
 * <p>
 * Possible error cases that the authorization server implementation itself
 * has to handle are as follows. Other error cases have already been covered
 * by {@code /api/backchannel/authentication} API.
