/**
 * A response from Authlete's {@code /vci/deferred/issue} API.
 *
 * <p>
 * A response from the {@code /vci/deferred/issue} API can be mapped to this
 * class. The API caller should extract the value of the {@code action}
 * parameter from the API response and take the next action based on the
 * value of the parameter.
 * </p>
 *
 * <hr>
 * <h3>{@code action} = {@link Action#OK OK}</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code action} value {@link Action#OK OK} means that a credential has
 * been issued successfully. In this case, the implementation of the deferred
 * credential endpoint should return a successful response to the request
 * sender. The HTTP status code and the content type of the response should
 * be 200 and {@code application/json}, respectively. The value of the
 * {@code responseContent} parameter can be used as the message body of the
 * response. It contains the "{@code credential}" parameter that conforms to
 * the specification of "Deferred Credential Response".
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 *
 * (Put the value of the "responseContent" parameter here.)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <hr>
 * <h3>{@code action} = {@link Action#FORBIDDEN FORBIDDEN}</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code action} value {@link Action#FORBIDDEN FORBIDDEN} means that
 * the use of the Authlete API is forbidden. In this case, the implementation
 * of the deferred credential endpoint should return an error response to the
 * request sender. The HTTP status code and the content type of the error
 * response should be 403 and {@code application/json}, respectively. The
 * value of the {@code responseContent} parameter can be used as the message
 * body of the error response as it conforms to the specification of
 * "Deferred Credential Error Response".
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 *
 * (Put the value of the "responseContent" parameter here.)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that this happens either when the {@link Service#isVerifiableCredentialsEnabled()
 * verifiableCredentialsEnabled} property of the {@link Service service} is
 * false or when the Authlete server does not support the feature of
 * "Verifiable Credentials". In either case, this "forbidden" issue should
 * be solved before the service is deployed in a production environment.
 * </p>
 *
 * <hr>
 * <h3>{@code action} = {@link Action#INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR}</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code action} value {@link Action#INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR}
 * means that something wrong happened on Authlete side. In this case, the
 * implementation of the deferred credential endpoint should return an error
 * response to the request sender. The HTTP status code and the content type
 * of the error response should be 500 and {@code application/json},
 * respectively. The value of the {@code responseContent} parameter can be
 * used as the message body of the error response as it conforms to the
 * specification of "Deferred Credential Error Response".
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 *
 * (Put the value of the "responseContent" parameter here.)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that, however, in real production deployments, it may be better to
 * return a vaguer error response instead of a bare one like above.
 * </p>
 *
 * <hr>
 * <h3>{@code action} = {@link Action#CALLER_ERROR CALLER_ERROR}</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code action} value {@link Action#CALLER_ERROR CALLER_ERROR} means
 * that the API call is wrong. For example, the "{@code order}" request
 * parameter is missing.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Caller errors should be solved before the service is deployed in a
 * production environment.
 * </p>

 * @since 3.70
 * @since Authlete 3.0
