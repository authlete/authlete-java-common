/**
 * Response from Authlete's {@code /vci/metadata} API.
 *
 * <p>
 * The Authlete API is supposed to be used from within the implementation of
 * the credential issuer metadata endpoint
 * ({@code /.well-known/openid-credential-issuer}).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Authlete's {@code /vci/metadata} API returns JSON which can be mapped to
 * this class. The credential issuer implementation should retrieve the value
 * of the <code>{@link #getAction() action}</code> response parameter from
 * the API response and take the following steps according to the value.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3><code>OK</code></h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the value of the <code>{@link #getAction() action}</code> response
 * parameter is <code>{@link Action#OK OK}</code>, it means that Authlete
 * could prepare credential issuer metadata successfully.
 * <p>
 *
 * </p>
 * In this case, the implementation of the credential issuer metadata endpoint
 * ({@code /.well-known/openid-credential-issuer}) of the credential issuer
 * should return an HTTP response with the HTTP status code "{@code 200 OK}"
 * and the content type "{@code application/json}". The message body of the
 * response has been prepared by Authlete's {@code /vci/metadata} API and it
 * is available as the <code>{@link #getResponseContent() responseContent}</code>
 * response parameter.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The implementation of the credential issuer metadata endpoint can construct
 * an HTTP response by doing like below.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * 200 OK
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * (Other HTTP headers)
 *
 * <i>(the value of the {@link #getResponseContent() responseContent} response parameter)</i></pre>
 *
 * <h3><code>NOT_FOUND</code></h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the value of the <code>{@link #getAction() action}</code> response
 * parameter is <code>{@link Action#NOT_FOUND NOT_FOUND}</code>, it means that
 * the service configuration has not enabled the feature of Verifiable
 * Credentials and so the credential issuer metadata endpoint should not be
 * accessed.
 * </p>
 *
 * </p>
 * In this case, the implementation of the credential issuer metadata endpoint
 * of the credential issuer should return an HTTP response with the HTTP status
 * code "{@code 404 Not Found}" and the content type "{@code application/json}".
 * The message body (= error information in the JSON format) of the response
 * has been prepared by Authlete's {@code /vci/metadata} API and it is available
 * as the <code>{@link #getResponseContent() responseContent}</code> response
 * parameter.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The implementation of the credential issuer metadata endpoint can construct
 * an HTTP response by doing like below.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * 404 Not Found
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * (Other HTTP headers)
 *
 * <i>(the value of the {@link #getResponseContent() responseContent} response parameter)</i></pre>
 *
 * <h3><code>INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR</code></h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the value of the <code>{@link #getAction() action}</code> response
 * parameter is <code>{@link Action#INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR}</code>,
 * it means that an unexpected error has occurred on Authlete side or the
 * service has not been set up properly yet.
 * </p>
 *
 * </p>
 * In this case, a simple implementation of the credential issuer metadata
 * endpoint would return an HTTP response with the HTTP status code
 * "{@code 500 Internal Server Error}" and the content type
 * "{@code application/json}". The message body (= error information in the JSON
 * format) of the response has been prepared by Authlete's {@code /vci/metadata}
 * API and it is available as the <code>{@link #getResponseContent()
 * responseContent}</code> response parameter.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Such simple implementation of the credential issuer metadata endpoint can
 * construct an HTTP response by doing like below.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * 500 Internal Server Error
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * (Other HTTP headers)
 *
 * <i>(the value of the {@link #getResponseContent() responseContent} response parameter)</i></pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * However, in real commercial deployments, it is rare for a credential issuer
 * to return "{@code 500 Internal Server Error}" when it encounters an
 * unexpected internal error. It's up to implementations of credential issuers
 * what they actually return in the case of internal server error.
