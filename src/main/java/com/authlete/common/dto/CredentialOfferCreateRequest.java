/**
 * Request to Authlete's {@code /vci/offer/create} API.
 *
 * <p>
 * The API is used to create a <b>credential offer</b>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A credential offer is a JSON object that is used as the value of the
 * {@code credential_offer} parameter sent to the credential offer endpoint
 * of the wallet or is returned from an endpoint designated by the
 * {@code credential_offer_uri} parameter.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A credential offer looks like below. Properties in this class (= request
 * parameters to the {@code /vci/offer/create} API) are used to control the
 * content of the credential offer being created.
 * </p>
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "credential_issuer": "...",
 *   "credentials": [ ... ],
 *   "grants": {
 *     "authorization_code": {
 *       "issuer_state": "..."
 *     },
 *     "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:pre-authorized_code": {

 *
 * <h3>Breaking Changes</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The "OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance" specification tends to
 * repeat breaking changes. Such changes affect this Java class.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In the past draft of the specification, elements in the "{@code credentials}"
 * array in a credential offer are either strings or JSON objects. Therefore, the
 * type of the "{@code credentials}" property in the previous implementation of
 * this class was a "string" whose content must be able to be parsed as a JSON
 * array. However, as a result of a breaking change in the specification, it is
 * ensured that all elements in the "{@code credentials}" array in a credential
 * offer are strings. To make it easier to treat the "{@code credentials}"
 * property of this class, the type of the property has been changed from a
 * string to an array of strings.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 3.59
 * @since Authlete 3.0

 * @see <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html"
