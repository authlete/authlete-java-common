/**
 * Response from the {@code /vci/single/parse} API.
 *
 * <p>
 * The response from the Authlete API is a JSON object and can be mapped to
 * this class. The API caller should retrieve the value of the {@code action}
 * parameter from the API response and take one of the following actions
 * accordingly.
 * </p>
 *
 * <hr>
 * <h3>{@code action} = {@link Action#OK OK}</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code action} value {@link Action#OK OK} means that the credential
 * request is valid. In this case, the implementation of the credential
 * endpoint should call the {@code /vci/single/issue} API in order to issue
 * a verifiable credential or a transaction ID and generate a response to
 * the request sender.
 * </p>
 *
 * <hr>
 * <h3>{@code action} = {@link Action#BAD_REQUEST BAD_REQUEST}</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code action} value {@link Action#BAD_REQUEST BAD_REQUEST} means that
 * the credential request is invalid. In this case, the implementation of the
 * credential endpoint should return an error response to the request sender.
 * The HTTP status code and the content type of the error response should be
 * 400 and {@code application/json}, respectively. The value of the
 * {@code responseContent} parameter can be used as the message body of the
 * error response as it conforms to the specification of "Credential Error
 * Response".
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 *
 * (Put the value of the "responseContent" parameter here.)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <hr>
 * <h3>{@code action} = {@link Action#UNAUTHORIZED UNAUTHORIZED}</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code action} value {@link Action#UNAUTHORIZED UNAUTHORIZED} means
 * that the access token is invalid. In this case, the implementation of the
 * credential endpoint should return an error response to the request sender.
 * The HTTP status code of the error response should be 401. The value of the
 * {@code responseContent} parameter can be used as the value of the
 * {@code WWW-Authenticate} HTTP header of the error response.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
 * WWW-Authenticate: (Put the value of the "responseContent" parameter here.)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that the implementation of the credential endpoint should call the
 * {@code /auth/introspection} API to check whether the access token is valid
 * BEFORE calling the {@code /vci/single/parse} API. The validation on the
 * access token by the {@code /vci/single/parse} API is limited and not
 * exhaustive. For example, the {@code /vci/single/parse} API does not check
 * certificate binding (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html"
 * >RFC 8705</a>).
 * </p>
 *
 * <hr>
 * <h3>{@code action} = {@link Action#FORBIDDEN FORBIDDEN}</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code action} value {@link Action#FORBIDDEN FORBIDDEN} means that
 * the use of the Authlete API is forbidden. In this case, the implementation
 * of the credential endpoint should return an error response to the request
 * sender. The HTTP status code and the content type of the error response
 * should be 403 and {@code application/json}, respectively. The value of the
 * {@code responseContent} parameter can be used as the message body of the
 * error response as it conforms to the specification of "Credential Error
 * Response".
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 *
 * (Put the value of the "responseContent" parameter here.)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that this happens either when the {@link Service#isVerifiableCredentialsEnabled()
 * verifiableCredentialsEnabled} property of the {@link Service service} is
 * false or when the Authlete server does not support the feature of
 * "Verifiable Credentials". In either case, this "forbidden" issue should
 * be solved before the service is deployed in a production environment.
 * </p>
 *
 * <hr>
 * <h3>{@code action} = {@link Action#INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR}</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code action} value {@link Action#INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR}
 * means that something wrong happened on Authlete side. In this case, the
 * implementation of the credential endpoint should return an error response
 * to the request sender. The HTTP status code and the content type of the
 * error response should be 500 and {@code application/json}, respectively.
 * The value of the {@code responseContent} parameter can be used as the
 * message body of the error response as it conforms to the specification of
 * "Credential Error Response".
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 *
 * (Put the value of the "responseContent" parameter here.)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that, however, in real production deployments, it may be better to
 * return a vaguer error response instead of a bare one like above.
 * </p>
