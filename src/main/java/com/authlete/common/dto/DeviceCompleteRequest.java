/**
 * Request to Authlete's {@code /api/device/complete} API.
 *
 * <p>
 * In the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8628.html"
 * >device flow</a>, an end-user accesses the verification endpoint of the
 * authorization server where she interacts with the verification endpoint
 * and inputs a user code. The verification endpoint checks if the user code
 * is valid and then asks the end-user whether she approves or rejects the
 * authorization request which the user code represents.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * After the authorization server receives the decision of the end-user, it
 * should call Authlete's {@code /api/device/complete} API to tell Authlete
 * the decision.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the end-user was authenticated and authorization was granted to the
 * client by the end-user, the authorization server should call the API with
 * {@code result=}{@link Result#AUTHORIZED AUTHORIZED}. In this successful
 * case, the {@code subject} request parameter is mandatory. The API will
 * update the database record so that {@code /api/auth/token} API can generate
 * an access token later.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the {@code scope} parameter of the device authorization request included
 * the {@code openid} scope, an ID token is generated. In this case, {@code sub},
 * {@code authTime}, {@code acr} and {@code claims} request parameters in the
 * API call to {@code /api/device/complete} affect the ID token.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the authorization server receives the decision of the end-user and it
 * indicates that she has rejected to give authorization to the client, the
 * authorization server should call the API with
 * {@code result=}{@link Result#ACCESS_DENIED ACCESS_DENIED}. In this case,
 * the API will update the database record so that the {@code /api/auth/token}
 * API can generate an error response later. If {@code errorDescription} and
 * {@code errorUri} request parameters are given to the
 * {@code /api/device/complete} API, they will be used as the values of
 * {@code error_description} and {@code error_uri} response parameters in the
 * error response from the token endpoint.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the authorization server could not get decision from the end-user for
 * some reasons, the authorization server should call the API with
 * {@code result=}{@link Result#TRANSACTION_FAILED TRANSACTION_FAILED}. In
 * this error case, the API will behave in the same way as in the case of
 * {@code ACCESS_DENIED}. The only difference is that {@code expired_token}
 * is used as the value of the {@code error} response parameter instead of
 * {@code access_denied}.

     * <p>
     * If the {@code claims} request parameter holds JSON, Authlete extracts

     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * For example, if the user has allowed the {@code profile} scope to be
     * tied to an access token being issued, it technically means that the
     * user has consented for the client application to know the following
     * claims based on the mapping defined in OpenID Connect Core 1.0 <a href=
     * "https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims"
     * >Section 5.4. Requesting Claims using Scope Values</a>: {@code name},

     * JSON of the {@code claims} request parameter does not necessarily
     * include all the claims. It may be simply because the authorization
     * server does not support other claims or because the authorization
     * server intends to return requested claims from the <a href=
     * "https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo"
     * >UserInfo Endpoint</a> instead of embedding them in an ID token, or
     * for some other reasons. Therefore, Authlete does not assume that the
     * claims in the JSON of the {@code claims} request parameter represent
     * the complete set of consented claims.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * This {@code consentedClaims} request parameter (supported from Authlete
     * 2.3) can be used to convey the exact set of consented claims to Authlete.
     * Authlete saves the information into its database and makes them
     * referrable in responses from the {@code /api/auth/introspection} API
     * and the {@code /api/auth/userinfo} API.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * In addition, the information conveyed via this {@code consentedClaims}
     * request parameter is used to compute the exact value of the {@code
     * claims} parameter in responses from the Grant Management Endpoint, which
     * is defined in <a href="https://openid.net/specs/fapi-grant-management.html"

     * {@code profile}) and the claims in the JSON of the {@code claims}
     * request parameter although Authlete knows the possibility that the
     * computed set may be different from the actual set of consented claims.
     * Especially, the computed set may not include claims that the
     * authorization server returns from the UserInfo Endpoint. Therefore,
     * if you want to control the exact set of consented claims, utilize this
