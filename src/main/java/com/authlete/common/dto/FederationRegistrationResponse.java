/**
 * Response from Authlete's {@code /federation/registration} API.
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * Authlete's {@code /federation/registration} API returns JSON which can
 * be mapped to this class. The authorization server implementation should
 * retrieve the value of the <code>{@link #getAction() action}</code>
 * response parameter from the API response and take the following steps
 * according to the value.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3><code>OK</code></h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the value of the <code>{@link #getAction() action}</code> response
 * parameter is <code>{@link Action#OK OK}</code>, it means that the client
 * registration request was processed successfully and a client was registered.
 * <p>
 *
 * </p>
 * In this case, the implementation of the federation registration endpoint of
 * the authorization server should return an HTTP response to the API caller
 * with the HTTP status code "{@code 200 OK}" and the content type
 * "{@code application/entity-statement+jwt}". The message body (= an entity
 * statement in the the JWT format) of the response has been prepared by Authlete's
 * {@code /federation/registration} API and it is available as the
 * <code>{@link #getResponseContent() responseContent}</code> response parameter.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The implementation of the federation registration endpoint can construct an
 * HTTP response by doing like below.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * 200 OK
 * Content-Type: application/entity-statement+jwt
 * (Other HTTP headers)
 *
 * <i>(the value of the {@link #getResponseContent() responseContent} response parameter)</i></pre>
 *
 * <h3><code>BAD_REQUEST</code></h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the value of the <code>{@link #getAction() action}</code> response
 * parameter is <code>{@link Action#BAD_REQUEST BAD_REQUEST}</code>, it means
 * that the client registration request is wrong or that a client having the
 * same entity ID has already been registered.
 * </p>
 *
 * </p>
 * In this case, the implementation of the federation registration endpoint of
 * the authorization server should return an HTTP response to the API caller
 * with the HTTP status code "{@code 400 Bad Request}" and the content type
 * "{@code application/json}". The message body (= error information in the
 * JSON format) of the response has been prepared by Authlete's
 * {@code /federation/registration} API and it is available as the
 * <code>{@link #getResponseContent() responseContent}</code> response parameter.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The implementation of the federation registration endpoint can construct an
 * HTTP response by doing like below.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * 400 Bad Request
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * (Other HTTP headers)
 *
 * <i>(the value of the {@link #getResponseContent() responseContent} response parameter)</i></pre>
 *
 * <h3><code>NOT_FOUND</code></h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the value of the <code>{@link #getAction() action}</code> response
 * parameter is <code>{@link Action#NOT_FOUND NOT_FOUND}</code>, it means that
 * the service configuration has not enabled the feature of <a href=
 * "https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html">OpenID Federation 1.0</a>
 * and so the federation registration endpoint should not be accessed.
 * </p>
 *
 * </p>
 * In this case, the implementation of the federation registration endpoint of
 * the authorization server should return an HTTP response to the API caller
 * with the HTTP status code "{@code 404 Not Found}" and the content type
 * "{@code application/json}". The message body (= error information in the
 * JSON format) of the response has been prepared by Authlete's
 * {@code /federation/registration} API and it is available as the
 * <code>{@link #getResponseContent() responseContent}</code> response parameter.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The implementation of the federation registration endpoint can construct an
 * HTTP response by doing like below.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * 404 Not Found
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * (Other HTTP headers)
 *
 * <i>(the value of the {@link #getResponseContent() responseContent} response parameter)</i></pre>
 *
 * <h3><code>INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR</code></h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the value of the <code>{@link #getAction() action}</code> response
 * parameter is <code>{@link Action#INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR}</code>,
 * it means that an unexpected error has occurred on Authlete side or the
 * service has not been set up properly yet. For example, when a JWK Set
 * for federation ({@code Service.}<code>{@link Service#getFederationJwks()
 * federationJwks}</code>) has not been set up, when authority hints
 * ({@code Service.}<code>{@link Service#getAuthorityHints()
 * authorityHints}</code>) have not been set up, etc.
 * </p>
 *
 * </p>
 * In this case, a simple implementation of the federation registration endpoint
 * would return an HTTP response to the client application with the HTTP status
 * code "{@code 500 Internal Server Error}" and the content type
 * "{@code application/json}". The message body (= error information in the JSON
 * format) of the response has been prepared by Authlete's
 * {@code /federation/registration} API and it is available as the
 * <code>{@link #getResponseContent() responseContent}</code> response parameter.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Such a simple implementation of the entity configuration endpoint can
 * construct an HTTP response by doing like below.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * 500 Internal Server Error
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * (Other HTTP headers)
 *
 * <i>(the value of the {@link #getResponseContent() responseContent} response parameter)</i></pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * However, in real commercial deployments, it is rare for an authorization
 * server to return "{@code 500 Internal Server Error}" when it encounters
 * an unexpected internal error. It's up to implementations of authorization
 * servers what they actually return to API callers in the case of internal
 * server error.
