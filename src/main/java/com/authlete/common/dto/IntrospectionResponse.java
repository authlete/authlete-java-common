/**
 * Response from Authlete's {@code /auth/introspection} API.
 *
 * <p>
 * Authlete's {@code /auth/introspection} API returns JSON which can
 * be mapped to this class. The service implementation should retrieve
 * the value of {@code "action"} from the response and take the following
 * steps according to the value.
 * </p>
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR"},
 * it means that the request from the service implementation was wrong or
 * that an error occurred in Authlete.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an
 * error on the server side. Therefore, the service implementation should
 * generate a response to the client application with the HTTP status of
 * {@code "500 Internal Server Error"}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} returns a string which describes the error
 * in the format of <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750">RFC 6750</a>
 * (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the protected resource of the service
 * implementation wants to return an error response to the client application
 * in the way that complies with RFC 6750, the string returned from {@link
 * #getResponseContent()} can be used as the value of {@code WWW-Authenticate}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error

 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache</pre>
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#BAD_REQUEST BAD_REQUEST}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "BAD_REQUEST"}, it means
 * that the request from the client application does not contain an access
 * token (= the request from the service implementation to Authlete does
 * not contain {@code "token"} parameter).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} returns a string which describes the error
 * in the format of <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750">RFC 6750</a>

 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
 * WWW-Authenticate: <i>(The value returned from {@link #getResponseContent()})</i>
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache</pre>
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#UNAUTHORIZED UNAUTHORIZED}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "UNAUTHORIZED"}, it means
 * that the access token does not exist or has expired. Or the client
 * application associated with the access token does not exist any longer.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} returns a string which describes the error
 * in the format of <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750">RFC 6750</a>
 * (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the protected resource of the service
 * implementation wants to return an error response to the client application
 * in the way that complies with RFC 6750, the string returned from {@link
 * #getResponseContent()} can be used as the value of {@code WWW-Authenticate}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.
 * </p>

 * Pragma: no-cache</pre>
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#FORBIDDEN FORBIDDEN}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "FORBIDDEN"}, it means
 * that the access token does not cover the required scopes or that the
 * subject associated with the access token is different from the subject
 * contained in the request.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} returns a string which describes the error
 * in the format of <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750">RFC 6750</a>
 * (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the protected resource of the service
 * implementation wants to return an error response to the client application
 * in the way that complies with RFC 6750, the string returned from {@link
 * #getResponseContent()} can be used as the value of {@code WWW-Authenticate}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
 * WWW-Authenticate: <i>(The value returned from {@link #getResponseContent()})</i>
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache</pre>
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#OK OK}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "OK"}, it means that the
 * access token which the client application presented is valid (= exists
 * and has not expired).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The service implementation is supposed to return the protected resource
 * to the client application.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When {@code "action"} is {@code "OK"}, {@link #getResponseContent()}
 * returns {@code "Bearer error=\"invalid_request\""}. This is the
 * simplest string which can be used as the value of {@code WWW-Authenticate}
 * header to indicate {@code "400 Bad Request"}. The service implementation
 * may use this string to tell the client application that the request was
 * bad. But in such a case, the service should generate a more informative
 * error message to help developers of client applications.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following is an example error response which complies with RFC 6750.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
 * WWW-Authenticate: <i>(The value returned from {@link #getResponseContent()})</i>
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache</pre>
 * </dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p>
 * Basically, {@link #getResponseContent()} returns a string which describes
 * the error in the format of <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750"
 * >RFC 6750</a> (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage). So, if the service has
 * selected {@code "Bearer"} as the token type, the string returned from
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} can be used directly as the value for
 * {@code WWW-Authenticate}. However, if the service has selected another
 * different token type, the service has to generate error messages for
 * itself.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>JWT-based access token</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * Since version 2.1, Authlete provides a feature to issue access tokens in
 * JWT format. This feature can be enabled by setting a non-null value to the
 * {@code accessTokenSignAlg} property of the service (see the description of
 * the {@link Service} class for details). {@code /auth/introspection} API
 * can accept access tokens in JWT format. However, note that the API does not
 * return information contained in a given JWT-based access token but returns
 * information stored in the database record which corresponds to the given
 * JWT-based access token. Because attributes of the database record can be
 * modified after the access token is issued (for example, by using {@code
 * /auth/token/update} API), information returned by {@code
 * /auth/introspection} API and information the given JWT-based access
 * token holds may be different.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>DPoP Nonce (Authlete 3.0 onwards)</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * Since version 3.0, Authlete recognizes the {@code nonce} claim in DPoP
 * proof JWTs. If the presented access token is bound to a public key through
 * the DPoP mechanism, and if the {@code nonce} claim is required (= if the
 * service's {@code dpopNonceRequired} property is {@code true}, or the value
 * of the {@code dpopNonceRequired} request parameter passed to the Authlete
 * API is {@code true}), the Authlete API checks whether the {@code nonce}
 * claim in the presented DPoP proof JWT is identical to the expected value.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the {@code dpopNonce} response parameter from the API is not null, its
 * value is the expected nonce value for DPoP proof JWT. The expected value
 * needs to be conveyed to the client application as the value of the
 * {@code DPoP-Nonce} HTTP header.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;"
 * >DPoP-Nonce: (The value returned from {@link #getDpopNonce()})</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * See <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9449.html">RFC 9449 OAuth
 * 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP)</a> for details.
