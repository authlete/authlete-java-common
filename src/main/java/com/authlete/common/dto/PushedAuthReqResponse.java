 *
 * <p>
 * Authlete's {@code /api/pushed_auth_req} API returns JSON which can be mapped

 * according to the value.
 * </p>
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#CREATED CREATED}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code action} is {@code CREATED}, it means that the

 * The authorization server implementation should generate a response to the
 * client application with {@code 201 Created} and {@code application/json}.

 * <h3>DPoP Nonce (Authlete 3.0 onwards)</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * Since version 3.0, Authlete recognizes the {@code nonce} claim in DPoP
 * proof JWTs. If the {@code nonce} claim is required (= if the service's
 * {@code dpopNonceRequired} property is {@code true}, or the value of the
 * {@code dpopNonceRequired} request parameter passed to the Authlete API
 * is {@code true}), the Authlete API checks whether the {@code nonce}
 * claim in the presented DPoP proof JWT is identical to the expected value.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the {@code dpopNonce} response parameter from the API is not null, its
 * value is the expected nonce value for DPoP proof JWT. The expected value
 * needs to be conveyed to the client application as the value of the
 * {@code DPoP-Nonce} HTTP header.
