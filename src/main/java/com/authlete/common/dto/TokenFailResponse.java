/**
 * Response from Authlete's {@code /auth/token/fail} API.
 *
 * <p>
 * Authlete's {@code /auth/token/fail} API returns JSON which can
 * be mapped to this class. The service implementation should retrieve
 * the value of {@code "action"} from the response and take the following
 * steps according to the value.
 * </p>
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR"},
 * it means that the request from the service implementation
 * ({@link AuthorizationFailRequest}) was wrong or that an error occurred
 * in Authlete.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an
 * error on the server side. Therefore, the service implementation should
 * generate a response to the client application with the HTTP status of
 * {@code "500 Internal Server Error"}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} returns a JSON string which describes
 * the error, so it can be used as the entity body of the response.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following illustrates the response which the service implementation
 * should generate and return to the client application.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
 * HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Cache-Control: no-store
 * Pragma: no-cache
 *
 * <i>(The value returned from {@link #getResponseContent()})</i></pre>
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt><b>{@link Action#BAD_REQUEST BAD_REQUEST}</b></dt>
 * <dd>
 * <p>
 * When the value of {@code "action"} is {@code "BAD_REQUEST"}, it means
 * that Authlete's {@code /auth/token/fail} API successfully generated
 * an error response for the client application.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application
 * must be {@code "400 Bad Request"} and the content type must be
 * {@code "application/json"}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #getResponseContent()} returns a JSON string which describes
 * the error, so it can be used as the entity body of the response.
 * </p>

 * The following illustrates the response which the service implementation
 * should generate and return to the client application.
